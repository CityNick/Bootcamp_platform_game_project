      <h3>Nick Andrei Trivino</h3>
      <p> Hello everyone, I'm a filipino student at City, studying Computer Science with Cyber Security MSCi.
          In terms of programming I have a moderate amount of experience with it, in particular
          when it comes to games, as it was part of my coursework for A levels in which we made a game
          with python. A few of my personal interests are simply coding, gaming, and most of all food ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°). </p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2021: Platform Game</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	City (2021). This Processing project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding 
	of the use of classes, arrays, subroutines and selection statements to create an
        interactive 2D platoform game. The game is not only able to differentiate between
        different platforms but can also apply collision effects when the player interacts
        with them, dependant on the platform and the parameters used when an instance was
        made. World scrolling with the use of selection statements, also gives the project
        the illusion of a much wider world than what is initally seen in the game window.
        Arrays are also used to cycle between the different sprite images for the player,
        giving the player a more lifelike animation rather than a still sprite.

    <h3>Programming With Java: City Game Coursework</h3>
    <p>
	For my Java coursework I was tasked with creating a game utilising city-engine, a physics engine designed
        by City, University of London. The concept I went for was a simple platformer game in which the player would need
        need to carefully navigate around each level, and avoid numerous bodies such as enemies and spikes and even false
        hearts.
    </p>
      
    <p>
	Programming with Java was definitely a challenge for me as I normally use Unity which utlises C# as opposed to Java. I had issues
        with making sure the view had focus, and quite a few errors when it came to collision as I needed the collision detectors to differentiate between the two bodies. It was however helpful to learn about how to save and load games by utilising a txt file and a writer to write data to that txt file. It's definitely something I want to implement in future games.
